            The Bronze, Silver and Gold stage awards ensure children have a solid safety 
            education, and have learned rescue and resuscitation techniques. Each stage of 
            the Rookie Lifeguard Awards is sub-divided into three levels and each stage runs 
            roughly for eight to ten weeks. The Rookie Lifeguard Awards programme also 
            includes a Water Safety Award, a Life Support Award and Achievement Awards.
