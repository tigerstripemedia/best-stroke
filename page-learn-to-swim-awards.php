                        at swimmers of five years and older and are designed to demonstrate 
                        the pupils’ ability to swim from A to B without pause and without 
                        stress.

                        There are 12 further Stroke Awards for children to achieve – 
                        5 metres, 10 metres and 25 metres in each of the four strokes.

                        It is vital that swimmers develop correct technique as early 
                        as possible and the Rainbow Distance Awards for front crawl, 
                        backstroke, breaststroke and butterfly can be used to reward 
                        and encourage the development of good standards across each 
                        of the four recognised swimming strokes.
